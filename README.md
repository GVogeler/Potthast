Index of recipients of Papal documents recorded in August Potthast: Regesta Pontificum Romanorum (1874)

This is the raw data of the database of the addressees of papal documents, as listed in the Regesta Pontificum Romanorum inde ab a. post Christum natum 1198 ad a. 1304, edited by August Potthast, 2 vols. (ND Graz 1957), Berlin 1874 - 1875 ([scan on archive.org](http://www.archive.org/details/RegestaPontificumRomanorum)). For contemporary criticism of the layout of the work, see Pietro Pressutti: I Regesti de' Romani Pontefici dall'anno 1198 all'anno 1304 per Augusto Potthast opera premiata dall'Accademia Letteraria di Berlino. Osservazioni storico-criti, Rome 1874. On the relationship between registers and the actual documentary tradition, see also Rudolf v. Heckel: Untersuchungen zu den Registern Innozenz' III, in: Historisches Jahrbuch 40 (1920), pp. 1-43.

The dataset containing approx. 78,000 entries (for approx. 26,000 numbers in Potthast) was created in 1995/6 to serve as the basis for a printed version of a register of index that the MGH wanted to publish. It contains the data recorded in Kleio, which was ported into XML and forked into a relational database. Unfortunately, both data entry errors and porting errors have not yet been corrected. In Feb. 2011 the relational database represents over 58,000 recipients, which stand for approx. 21,000 persons and institutions to whom the Pope's Chancery addressed letters.

In the data directory you find the XML version of the raw data, following the schema in ./data/potthast.xsd

In the current state of editing, some inflection forms of the entries have not yet been normalized. Potthast also often uses French terms, which also not normalized.

The following people worked on the project: Georg Vogeler (director), Katharina Gutermuth, Carl Philip Emanuel Nothaft, Carlo Daniel Pangerl, Benedikt Hotz, Veronika Bischel, Martin Jäger, Julian Schulz, Klara Harjung, Renate Vogeler (+)

I would like to thank Gerhard Schmitz, Irmgard Fees, Karl Heinz, Gábor Barabás and Gergely Kiss for their comments and financial support.
